# Responsive-Club-Website

## Project Requirements

In this project, I will build a webpage for a local club. I can choose everything about the page, including the club name, page layout and styling, and any images that I want to use. I can check out the [example site](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/responsive-club-site/example-site/index.html) for some inspiration and experiment with what elements are responsive. The full code for this site will be provided in the solution section at the end of the project.

A helpful resource for finding beautiful images for my site is [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

My project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I learned. In the example project, percentages and relative units like `em` and `rem` were used in the CSS to size and position page elements. The website was made responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate include:

- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of `width` after a certain minimum screen size.
- Using a `@media` rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
- Employing responsive units `em` and `rem` to size and space elements with `width` and `padding`.
